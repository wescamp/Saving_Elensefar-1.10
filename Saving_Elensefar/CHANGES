Version 1.1, 7-11-07

Last version maintained by Turin.


Version 1.2, 03-07-08

New maintainer: friar tuck

Changes:

* Show stopper wrt BfW 1.4 which would suppress sea battle on
  interactive bigmap
  FIXED

* Some updates to unit cfgs: magical weapon special for shadow mage,
  default AMLA (with full healing), move type for ships to get rid of
  annoying error message.

* Black Galleon movable after restart of interactive bigmap.

* Sunken enemy ships not being displayed.
  FIXED

Known issues:

* Most custom stuff (terrain, units) is outdated. Some cfg issues have
  been fixed (see above), but it all needs a complete overhaul. A lot
  of things (Highwayman or Shadow Mage, for instance) are redundant
  anyway, because they are Mainline or part of a mainline campaign in
  the meantime.

* A lot of things (names, items, attacks) are currently not displayed,
  probably owing to outdated cfg syntax or changed locations for
  graphics.


Version 1.2.1, 07-07-08

Changes:

* Added new-style "translate" declaration.

* Replaced outdated "music" declarations, music should be playing again.

* fixed outdated "barrel" terrain
